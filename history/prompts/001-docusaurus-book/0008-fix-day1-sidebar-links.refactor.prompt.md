## Prompt

day one link not working pls check and update it.

## Response snapshot

Investigated and fixed Day 1 navigation issues:

**Investigation Results:**
- All 6 individual tutorial pages were working correctly:
  - `/docs/day1/module-2-fundamentals/six-part-framework` ✓
  - `/docs/day1/module-2-fundamentals/context-engineering` ✓
  - `/docs/day1/module-3-advanced/image-generation` ✓
  - `/docs/day1/module-3-advanced/video-generation` ✓
  - `/docs/day1/module-3-advanced/ui-development` ✓
  - `/docs/day1/module-3-advanced/ux-design` ✓

**Issue Found:**
- Sidebar had `items: []` (empty) for each day category
- Module category pages weren't being generated properly
- `_category_.json` with `generated-index` wasn't creating index pages in expected location

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `sidebars.ts` to use `autogenerated` items:
```typescript
items: [
  {
    type: 'autogenerated',
    dirName: 'day1',
  },
],
```

This enables:
- Automatic sidebar item generation from directory structure
- Proper category index pages at `/docs/category/module-*`
- Complete navigation tree for all days

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Fixed sidebar navigation for Day 1, 2, 3 modules
- 🧪 Tests: Build passed, all WebFetch verifications successful
- 📁 Files: 1 file modified (sidebars.ts)
- 🔁 Next prompts: None - links working
- 🧠 Reflection: Empty `items: []` was preventing autogeneration

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None after fix
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All links PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - issue resolved
