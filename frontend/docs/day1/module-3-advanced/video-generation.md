# AI Video Generation: Cinematic Prompting Guide

Learn to create professional-quality videos using AI tools like Google Veo 3, Runway, and Pika Labs. This guide teaches structured prompting for video generation with synchronized audio.

## Core Principle

> **"The more structured, visual, and contextual your input, the closer the output matches your creative vision."**

## Key Concepts

### Cinematic Specificity

Replace generic descriptions with vivid, technical language:

| Weak Prompt | Strong Prompt |
|-------------|---------------|
| "a person walking" | "Medium shot of a woman in flowing red dress walking through misty forest at golden hour, camera tracking left to right" |
| "someone talking" | "Close-up of confident speaker, soft key light from left, subtle head movement while delivering message" |

### Narrative Structure

Effective video prompts follow this sequence:

```
1. Camera movement/angle
2. Subject and action
3. Environment/atmosphere
4. Audio elements
5. Technical cinematography details
```

---

## Optimal Prompt Anatomy

A complete video prompt includes **eight components**:

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Camera Movement | How the camera moves | "Slow push in", "tracking left" |
| Subject | Who/what is in frame | "SIEHS paramedic in uniform" |
| Action | What's happening | "checking medical equipment" |
| Environment | Setting/location | "inside modern ambulance" |
| Lighting | Light quality/direction | "soft diffused daylight" |
| Audio | Sound elements | "radio chatter, equipment sounds" |
| Style | Visual aesthetic | "documentary, cinematic" |
| Duration | Pacing consideration | "moment of focus and preparation" |

### SIEHS Example Prompt

```
Medium shot slowly pushing in on a SIEHS paramedic in navy
blue uniform, methodically checking defibrillator equipment
inside a modern ambulance bay, soft diffused daylight through
open doors, "All units ready for dispatch" heard over radio
with subtle equipment beeps, documentary realism style with
natural color grading, conveying professionalism and readiness
```

---

## Practical Examples

### 1. Corporate Brand Video

**Use Case**: Website hero, about page, recruitment

```
Smooth dolly shot revealing SIEHS command center, operators
at digital workstations with screens displaying emergency
maps, cool blue ambient lighting from monitors mixed with
overhead fluorescents, keyboard typing and radio dispatch
audio, professional corporate aesthetic with clean color
grading, establishing authority and coordination
```

### 2. Training Content

**Use Case**: Educational videos, onboarding materials

```
Medium shot of instructor demonstrating CPR technique on
training mannequin, well-lit training room environment,
instructor speaks clearly "Now apply firm pressure here",
camera holds steady for clear visibility, documentary
educational style, informative and accessible tone
```

### 3. Emergency Response Showcase

**Use Case**: Public awareness, capability demonstration

```
Tracking shot following ambulance crew responding to call,
starting wide then pushing to medium shot of team in action,
siren audio fading to focused team communication, golden
hour lighting creating urgency, cinematic documentary style,
conveying speed and competence
```

### 4. Social Media Content

**Use Case**: Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts

```
Handheld vertical frame capturing paramedic's morning routine,
checking gear bag with practiced efficiency, natural window
light, authentic ambient sounds of equipment and movement,
casual "day in the life" style, relatable and humanizing
```

### 5. Testimonial/Interview

**Use Case**: Stakeholder communications, annual reports

```
Medium close-up of healthcare worker sharing experience,
soft key light from 45-degree angle with subtle fill,
genuine eye contact with camera, clear voice saying
"Every call matters to us", shallow depth of field,
professional interview aesthetic, trustworthy and sincere
```

## Audio Design Strategy

Video AI excels when given explicit audio guidance:

### Audio Layer Types

| Layer | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Dialogue | Spoken words | Use quotation marks: "Code blue, room 305" |
| Sound Effects | Specific sounds | "door opening, footsteps on tile" |
| Ambient | Background audio | "hospital corridor ambience, distant PA system" |
| Music | Score/soundtrack | "subtle inspirational underscore building" |

### Audio Best Practices

```
Good: "Radio crackles with 'Unit 7, respond to Main Street',
      equipment beeps in background, subtle tense underscore"

Avoid: "Loud music AND quiet dialogue" (conflicting levels)
```

---

## Camera Control Techniques

### Movement Types

| Movement | Command Phrase | Effect |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Static | "Camera holds steady" | Stability, focus |
| Push In | "Slow push toward subject" | Building intensity |
| Pull Back | "Camera slowly pulls back" | Reveal, context |
| Track | "Tracking shot left to right" | Following action |
| Handheld | "Organic documentary style" | Authenticity |
| Crane | "Crane shot rising above" | Grandeur, overview |

### Shot Types

| Shot | Description | SIEHS Use |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Wide/Establishing | Shows full environment | Facility tours |
| Medium | Subject from waist up | Training, interviews |
| Close-up | Face or detail | Emotional moments |
| Extreme Close-up | Specific detail | Equipment, procedures |

---

## Visual Style Specification

### Lighting Descriptions

| Setup | Description | Mood |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Key Light | Main light, usually from 45° | Professional |
| Fill Light | Reduces shadows | Approachable |
| Rim Light | Behind subject, creates edge | Dramatic |
| Natural | Window/ambient light | Authentic |
| Golden Hour | Warm sunset/sunrise | Inspirational |
| Blue Hour | Cool pre-dawn/dusk | Contemplative |

### Color Treatment

| Style | Description | Application |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Natural | True-to-life colors | Documentary |
| Warm Grading | Orange/yellow tones | Friendly, approachable |
| Cool Grading | Blue/teal tones | Professional, clinical |
| High Contrast | Deep shadows, bright highlights | Dramatic |
| Desaturated | Muted colors | Serious, contemplative |

---

## Duration Awareness

Most AI video tools generate **8-second clips**. This constraint requires focused prompting:

### Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Focus on one pivotal moment | Try to tell complete story |
| Single clear action | Multiple scene transitions |
| Consistent mood throughout | Emotional whiplash |
| One dialogue line | Full conversations |

### Effective 8-Second Moments

```
Good: "Paramedic opens ambulance door, morning light streams in,
      takes deep breath and says 'Let's save some lives today'"

Poor: "Paramedic wakes up, gets ready, drives to work, arrives,
      checks in, gets assignment, prepares ambulance, responds
      to call" (too much for 8 seconds)
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Excessive complexity | Too much for 8 seconds | Focus on one moment |
| Conflicting audio | Loud music + quiet dialogue | Layer audio thoughtfully |
| Vague camera direction | "Make it cinematic" | Specific movement instructions |
| Generic styling | "Make it look professional" | Concrete visual specs |
| Impossible physics | Illogical spatial relationships | Maintain reality |

## Exercise: Create Your SIEHS Video Prompt

**Task**: Create a prompt for a 1122 Emergency recruitment video clip

**Requirements**:
- Show emergency responders in action
- Include professional audio elements
- Convey urgency and dedication
- Suitable for social media sharing

**Template to complete**:

```
[Camera movement] capturing [SIEHS subject] in [action],
[environment description], [lighting specification],
[audio: dialogue/effects/ambient], [visual style],
conveying [emotion/message for recruitment]
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Think in moments**: 8 seconds = one powerful moment, not a story
2. **Layer your audio**: Dialogue + effects + ambient + music
3. **Be specific with camera**: Movement type + shot type + direction
4. **Match style to purpose**: Corporate, documentary, cinematic, or social
5. **Maintain physics**: Keep spatial and temporal logic consistent
