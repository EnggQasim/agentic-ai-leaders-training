# AI Image Generation: Professional Prompting Guide

Master the art of creating professional-quality images with AI using structured prompts. This guide teaches you how to craft effective prompts for tools like Google Gemini, DALL-E, and Midjourney.

## Core Principle

> **"The more structured, visual, and contextual your input, the closer the output matches your intent."**

## Three Foundational Rules

### 1. Specificity Over Generality

Replace vague descriptions with precise technical language:

| Weak Prompt | Strong Prompt |
|-------------|---------------|
| "nice portrait" | "hyper-realistic studio portrait with professional lighting" |
| "person in office" | "confident executive in modern glass-walled corner office" |
| "good looking photo" | "editorial-quality photograph with shallow depth of field" |

### 2. Visual Hierarchy

Build prompts from broad to specific:

```
Subject → Environment → Lighting → Technical Details → Mood
```

### 3. Professional Photography Language

Use camera terminology for realistic results:
- **Lens**: 85mm, 35mm, wide-angle
- **Aperture**: f/1.4, f/2.8, f/8
- **Lighting**: Rembrandt, butterfly, split, loop
- **Style**: editorial, cinematic, documentary

---

## Effective Prompt Anatomy

A well-structured prompt includes **seven essential elements**:

```
1. Subject description
2. Pose/action
3. Environment
4. Lighting specifications
5. Style/aesthetic
6. Technical camera settings
7. Mood/atmosphere
```

### SIEHS Healthcare Example

```
Professional corporate headshot of a SIEHS emergency medical
technician in navy blue uniform, confident posture with arms
crossed, standing in modern ambulance bay with emergency
vehicles visible behind, soft diffused lighting from overhead
panels, editorial photography style, 85mm lens at f/2.8 for
natural background blur, conveying competence and reliability
```

## Practical Examples

### 1. Professional Branding Portrait

**Use Case**: LinkedIn profiles, team pages, ID cards

```
Corporate headshot of [subject], professional attire with
SIEHS logo visible on collar, neutral gray studio background,
Rembrandt lighting setup with soft fill, shot with 85mm lens
at f/2.8, warm color temperature, conveying approachability
and professionalism
```

### 2. Healthcare Environment Shot

**Use Case**: Marketing materials, website imagery

```
Wide-angle photograph of SIEHS emergency response team in
action, modern command center background with digital displays,
fluorescent overhead lighting mixed with screen glow,
documentary photography style, 35mm lens at f/4, high contrast
with cool blue tones, conveying urgency and coordination
```

### 3. Training Materials Visual

**Use Case**: Educational content, presentations

```
Clean infographic-style illustration showing emergency triage
process, flat design aesthetic with SIEHS blue color palette
(#1e88e5), white background, minimal shadows, vector-style
graphics, clear visual hierarchy with numbered steps
```

### 4. Social Media Content

**Use Case**: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter posts

```
Lifestyle photograph of paramedic checking equipment in
ambulance, golden hour lighting streaming through open doors,
candid moment captured with 50mm lens, warm color grading,
slight film grain for authentic feel, conveying dedication
and preparation
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Layered Lighting Descriptions

Structure light sources hierarchically:

```
Primary: Key light from 45-degree angle, soft and directional
Secondary: Fill light on opposite side, reducing shadows by 50%
Accent: Rim light from behind, creating subject separation
Ambient: Warm background glow suggesting office environment
```

### Composition Rules

Reference established techniques:

| Technique | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Rule of Thirds | Subject at intersection points | Portraits, landscapes |
| Leading Lines | Lines drawing eye to subject | Action shots, environments |
| Negative Space | Empty areas for text/balance | Marketing materials |
| Shallow Depth | Blurred background | Focus on subject |

### Color Psychology

| Color Tone | Psychological Effect | SIEHS Application |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Warm golden | Approachability, trust | Public communications |
| Cool blue | Professionalism, calm | Corporate materials |
| High contrast B&W | Timelessness, drama | Annual reports |
| SIEHS Blue (#1e88e5) | Brand recognition | All official materials |
