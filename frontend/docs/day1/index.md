# Day 1: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

Welcome to Day 1 of the SIEHS Agentic AI Training! Today you'll learn how to communicate effectively with AI systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 1, you will be able to:

- Understand what Large Language Models (LLMs) are and how they work
- Apply the **Six-Part Prompting Framework** for 10x better results
- Master **Context Engineering** for building AI systems
- Use zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques
- Configure AI parameters for different use cases
- Create a personal prompt library for SIEHS tasks

## Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to AI & LLMs
